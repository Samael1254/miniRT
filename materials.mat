# This .mat material formats lists materials that will be used in a .rt scene
# It also defines textures and normal maps to be used in the materials

# Texture
# tx [filename]
# - filename : .xpm file containing the texture (relative path starting from the executable directory)

# Normal map
# nm [filename]
# - filename : .xpm file containing the normal map (relative path starting from the executable directory)

# Material
# A material defining the visual appearance of any object it is applied to.
# Materials must be defined after textures and normal maps
# mt [kd] ([ks] ([ka]) [s]) ([tx]) ([nm])
# - kd : r,g,b : diffuse color (in range [0-255])
# - ks : r,g,b : specular color (in range [0-255]) (if not specified, defaults to kd)
# - ka : r,g,b : ambiant color (in range [0-255]) (if not specified, defaults to kd)
# - s : specularity, how much the material shines (in range [0-1]) (if not specified, defaults to 0)
# - tx : texture of the material (merges with the colors given above), as an index of the textures list given above. 0 means no texture. Defaults to 0, but if a normal map is specified a texture must be specified (and vice versa)
# - nm : normal map of the material, as an index of the normal maps list given above. 0 means no normal map. Defaults to 0, but if a texture is specified a normal map must be specified (and vice versa)
